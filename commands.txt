Extended grep
`````````````
# grep -E 
OR
# egrep
- Using grep -E (or egrep) enables the use of extended regular expressions, 
which allow more powerful pattern matching. 
One of the features of extended regex is the use of {} for specifying ranges.

{} : Specifies the number or range of repetitions of the preceding pattern.

[] : char class
{} : range

grep -E "[a-z]{10}" filename or egrep "[a-z]{10}" filename
- [a-z]{10} : Matches exactly 10 lowercase letters in a row (e.g., abcdefghij).

grep -E "[a-z]{10,20}" filename

- Assigned when    - Additional group(s)
  user is created     user belongs to.
- User's login     - Doesn't affect 
  group.              login.
- Defined in       - Defined in 
  `/etc/passwd`.      `/etc/group`.

1. Create a user as a primary member of a group.

# groupadd groupname
- Create a new group with the name `groupname`.

# useradd -g groupname username
- Create a new user `username` and assign `groupname` as their primary group.

Basic Permissions: [ File based ]
------------------

ls -l
- List files and directories in long format, displaying permissions, ownership, size, and modification date.

ls -l filename
- Display detailed information (long format) about a specific file.

ls -R
- Recursively list all files and directories, including subdirectories and their contents.

1) Symbolic Method
===================
read	: r
write	: w
execute	: x
------------
user owner	: u
group owner	: g
Others		: o
All		: a
------------
Assign		: +
Remove		: -
Overwrite	: =
------------


Permission Area:
----------------
--- : user owner
--- : group owner
--- : Others

# ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   43 Sep 23 01:56 file1


Default permissions for file (644): 
-----------------------------
read & write	: u
read		: g
read		: o

Default permissions for dir (755): 
----------------------------
read, write & execute	: u
read & execute		: g
read & execute		: o

Change permissions in Symbolic method:
---------------------------------------
# chmod u+rx file/dir
- Give the user (owner) read and execute permissions on the file/directory.

# chmod u-r,g+rw,o-rwx file/dir
- Remove read permission from the user, give the group read and write permissions, and remove all permissions for others.

# chmod u=rw file/dir
- Set the user’s permissions to read and write only, removing any other permissions.

# chmod ugo=r file/dir
- Set read-only permissions for the user, group, and others.

# chmod a=r file/dir
- Set read-only permissions for all users (user, group, and others).

# chmod +x file/dir
- Add execute permission to all users (user, group, and others).

2) Numeric Method
-----------------

read	: 4
write	: 2
execute	: 1
Full	: 7
No	: 0

---	000	0
r--	100	4	
-w-	010	2
--x	001	1
rwx	111	7

# chmod 711 file/dir
- Set read, write, and execute permission for the user, and execute permission for group and others.

# chmod 111 dir -R
- Set execute-only permission for user, group, and others recursively on a directory and its contents.

umask
- To check the current `umask` value, which controls default file and directory permissions.

umask 0000
- To change the `umask` value to `0000`. Here, the first `0` represents special permissions.

Default Permission Calculation:
```````````````````````````````````

Default Permission for Directory: Calculated as 777 - umask.
- If umask is 0000, the default permission for a directory will be 777 (full read, write, and execute permissions for all).
Default Permission for File: Calculated as 666 - umask.
- If umask is 0000, the default permission for a file will be 666 (read and write permissions for all, but no execute permission).

Example:
- If umask is 0022:
  - Directory default permission: 777 - 022 = 755 (rwx for user, rx for group and others).
  - File default permission: 666 - 022 = 644 (rw for user, r for group and others).
The umask controls how permissions are masked when new files and directories are created.

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

# OWNERSHIP IN LINUX
````````````````````````

Every file and directory in Linux has an associated owner and group. 
Ownership determines who can access or modify the file.

- To check the current ownership of a file, use the following command:
ls -l filename
- Example:
ls -l myfile.txt
- Output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 john developers 1024 Mar 10 10:30 myfile.txt
- In this example, 'john' is the owner, and 'developers' is the group.

- To change the user ownership of a file, use the 'chown' command:
chown username filename
- Example:
chown john myfile.txt
- This command changes the ownership of 'myfile.txt' to the user 'john'.
- 'john' will now have permissions over the file according to the file's permission settings.

- To change the group ownership of a file, use the 'chgrp' command:
chgrp groupname filename
- Example:
chgrp developers myfile.txt
- This command changes the group ownership of 'myfile.txt' to 'developers'.

- You can also change both the user and group ownership of a file in a single command:
chown username:groupname filename
- Example:
chown john:developers myfile.txt
- In this case, 'john' becomes the owner and 'developers' is the group.

But what if you want to give ownership to someone in "others"?
In Linux, "others" refers to users who are neither the owner nor part of the group.
If a user from the "others" category needs ownership, you can follow these steps:

# Step 1: Change ownership to the user in "others":
chown username filename
- Example:
chown jane myfile.txt
# This removes 'jane' from the "others" category and makes her the owner of 'myfile.txt'.

# Step 2: If needed, add the user to a specific group using the 'usermod' command:
usermod -G groupname username
- Example:
usermod -G developers jane
- This command adds 'jane' to the 'developers' group.

# Step 3: Change the group ownership of the file to the appropriate group:
chgrp groupname filename
- Example:
chgrp developers myfile.txt
- This changes the group ownership of 'myfile.txt' to 'developers', where 'jane' is now a member.

RECURSIVE OWNERSHIP CHANGES

If you want to change the ownership of a directory and ALL its contents (files and subdirectories),
you need to use the '-R' option to apply the change recursively.

- To recursively change the user ownership of a directory and its contents:
chown -R username directoryname
- Example:
chown -R john /mydir
- This command changes the ownership of '/mydir' and all the files and subdirectories within to 'john'.

- To recursively change the group ownership of a directory and its contents:
chgrp -R groupname directoryname
- Example:
chgrp -R developers /mydir
- This command changes the group ownership of '/mydir' and all its contents to 'developers'.

- To change both the user and group ownership recursively:
chown -R username:groupname directoryname
- Example:
chown -R john:developers /mydir
- This changes both the user and group ownership of '/mydir' and all its contents to 'john' and 'developers'.

OTHER USEFUL OWNERSHIP COMMANDS

Sometimes, you might need to check which files are owned by a specific user or group.

- To find all files owned by a particular user, you can use the 'find' command:
find /path/to/search -user username
- Example:
find /home -user john
- This command finds all files under '/home' that are owned by 'john'.

- Similarly, you can search for files belonging to a specific group:
find /path/to/search -group groupname
- Example:
find /home -group developers
- This command finds all files under '/home' that belong to the 'developers' group.

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

ACCESS CONTROL LIST (ACL)

To apply ACL, we don't need to change basic permission OR
any ownership of a file or a folder/directory.




Process Management:

```````````````````
Process:
````````
- Any running program is a process
- Multiple instances of the same program are processes.
- Shell is also a process


Process ID (PID)
````````````````
- Each linux process is identified by unique id PID 
- Every process has a Parent Process ID (PPID)
	+ Except "init"

Create a Process:
`````````````````
Terminal#1
```````````
# sleep 100

Terminal#2
```````````
# ps -la		[ Show the processes with PID & PPID ]

Managing Processes:
````````````````````
- Linux kernel tracks what each process is doing
- Process is assigned a priority
- Address space assigned to the process
- Files is the process allowed to access
- Is the process a ?:-
	+ Parent
	+ Child
	+ Zombie

=> Sometimes the parent dies first
``````````````````````````````````
- If the parent just exits or dies, the child process is left running
- The child's PPID is no longer valid due to parent is gone.
- Linux calls these children processes "Zombies"
- In Linux a zombie is just a process in which the children are adopted by the "init" process
- The init process will eventually cleanup the zombie childrens

PPID[kill]
	\___________PID[kill]

PPID[die]
	\___________PID[zombie]
