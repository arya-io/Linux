Q. Write a menu based script which displays the following options :

1. Make a file. 
2. Display contents
3. Copy the file
4. Rename the file
5. Delete the file
6. Exit
Enter your option:

If the user selects option 1, accept a file name from the user. If the file exists, 
then display an error message pass the control to the menu. If the file does not exist, 
then allow the user to enter some data. Pressing would save the contents and display the menu.

If the user selects option 2, then accept a file name fromthe user. If the file exists, 
then display the contents of the file. If the file does not exist, then display suitable error message. 
After this process, display the menu to accept another option. 

Selecting Option 3 allows the user to accept 
the source file and target file. If the source file exists and is readable, then accept the target file name. 
If the sourcefile does not exist, then display suitable error message. If the target file does not exist, 
then copy the contents of the source file to the target file. If the target file exists, then display suitable 
message and go back to the menu. 

Option 4 is similar to option 3 but rename the file instead of copying. 

Selecting option 5 allows the user to enter a file name. If the file exists, then check to see if it is writable.
If so, then delete the file with confirmation from the user. If the file does not exist, then display suitable error message.
