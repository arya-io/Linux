Lambda Function Serverless:
`````````````````````````````
AWS Lambda is a compute service that Runs code without thinking any servers or underlying services. It is a Serverless function that you only responsible for your actual code. 

AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform provided by Amazon as a part of Amazon Web Services.


def lambda_handler(event, context):
    print(event)
    return 'Hello from Lambda!'



Example of Lambda Serverless Functions:
```````````````````````````````````````````````

s3 bucket trigger:
``````````````````
1. Goto service IAM -> Roles -> Create Role -> In Trusted entity type [ select : AWS service ] -> In Use case [select: Lambda] -> Next -> In Permissions policies [search for "S3" and select "AmazonS3FullAccess" ] AND [search for "cloudwatchfullaccess" and select "CloudWatchFullAccessV2" ] AND [search for "LambdaBasic" and select "AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" ]-> Next -> Role name [ "s3s3s3s3" ] -> Create Role

2. Create Lambda function from scratch with python env -> In "Change default execution role" -> Select "Use an existing role" named as "s3s3s3s3" (for this example) -> Create Function

Code snippet start
```
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    print("Lambda Triggereddddddddddddddddddd")
    return {
        print('Hello from Lambda!')
    }

```
Code snippet end

3. Create Access & Secret Key to access AWS via AWSCLI

4. Create S3 bucket

5. Go to Lambda function & create Trigger -> Trigger configuration [search for "S3"] -> select the S3 bucket name "bucket_fun_lambda" -> Event types [select "All object create events" for this example] -> Add

6. # aws s3 cp localfile.txt s3://bucket_fun_lambda

7. To verify: Go to "Cloudwatch" service -> Log groups -> Select your log group -> /aws/lambda/<lambda_fun_name> -> check logs
